                <p>Kalaripayattu is an ancient martial art that originated in Kerala, India, over 3,000 years ago. It is one of the oldest surviving fighting systems in existence. "Kalari" refers to the battlefield, and "Payattu" means fight or practice. This art form is said to have been taught by the warrior-sage Parasurama, an avatar of Lord Vishnu.</p>
