            <!-- Origin -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>1. Origin</h3>
                <p>Ayurveda is believed to be more than 3,000 years old and finds its roots in ancient Vedic culture. The word "Ayurveda" is derived from two Sanskrit words—<em>Ayu</em> meaning "life" and <em>Veda</em> meaning "knowledge" or "science." Hence, Ayurveda translates to the "science of life."</p>

                <h3>2. Philosophical Basis</h3>
                <p>Ayurveda is deeply connected to the natural rhythms of life and emphasizes the balance between mind, body, and environment. It views health not just as the absence of disease but as the harmonious functioning of the entire system. The central concept is the balance of the three doshas (<em>Vata</em>, <em>Pitta</em>, and <em>Kapha</em>) that represent air, fire, and water elements, respectively.</p>

                    <li><strong>Vata (Air and Space):</strong> Governs movement and is responsible for bodily functions like breathing and circulation. When unbalanced, it can lead to anxiety and digestive issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pitta (Fire and Water):</strong> Governs digestion and metabolism. Imbalance can result in anger, inflammation, and ulcers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kapha (Water and Earth):</strong> Governs structure and lubrication. When unbalanced, it can cause lethargy and weight gain.</li>
                </ul>
