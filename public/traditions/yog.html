            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>1. Origin</h3>
                <p>Yog originated in ancient India over 5,000 years ago. Its first documented mention is found in the <em>Rig Veda</em>, one of the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism. The practice of Yog was refined and developed over millennia by sages and seers, especially through the teachings of <em>Patanjali</em> in his <em>Yog Sutras</em>.</p>

                <h3>2. Philosophical Foundation</h3>
                <p>Yog is more than just a set of physical exercises; it is a complete lifestyle practice. The word “Yog” means union - signifying the integration of body, mind, and spirit. The aim is to achieve a balanced life and, ultimately, spiritual enlightenment (<em>Moksha</em>). The essence of Yog lies in controlling one’s thoughts, desires, and actions, achieving a state of balance and peace.</p>
