            <!-- Origin -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>1. Origin</h3>
                <p>Vedic Mathematics comes from the <em>Atharvaveda</em>, one of the four ancient Vedas, and was further developed in the early 20th century by Swami Bharati Krishna Tirthaji. His rediscovery of Vedic Mathematics consists of 16 sutras (aphorisms) that simplify and speed up arithmetic operations.</p>

            <!-- Philosophy -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>2. Philosophy</h3>
                <p>Vedic Mathematics isnâ€™t just a set of tricks for fast calculations; it is a deep and intuitive approach to mathematics. It encourages flexible thinking and creativity, allowing multiple ways to solve a problem. The focus is on mental calculation, fostering cognitive skills and reducing dependence on calculators.</p>
