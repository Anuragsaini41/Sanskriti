        <h3>1. Origin</h3>
        <p>
          The <em>Vedas</em> are a collection of ancient sacred texts that form the foundation of Hindu philosophy and spirituality. They are believed to have been composed over 3,500 years ago, passed down through oral tradition before being written down. The term "Veda" means knowledge, and these texts are considered divine revelations to sages known as <em>Rishis</em>.

        <h3>2. Philosophical Foundation</h3>
        <p>
          The Vedas are divided into four main texts: the <em>Rigveda</em>, <em>Yajurveda</em>, <em>Samaveda</em>, and <em>Atharvaveda</em>. They encompass hymns, rituals, and philosophical teachings that address questions about the universe, the nature of existence, and the role of humans in the cosmos. The Vedas provide the basis for Hindu ritual, worship, and ethical conduct, emphasizing Dharma (duty) and Karma (action).
