                <p>The <em>Mahabhart (महाभारत)</em> is one of the two great Sanskrit epics of ancient India, attributed to the sage <em>Vyasa</em>. It is the longest epic poem in the world, consisting of over 100,000 verses. The Mahabhart tells the story of the rivalry between two families, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, culminating in the great battle of Kurukshetra.</p>

The <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>, a key philosophical discourse delivered by Krishna to Arjuna, is an integral part of the Mahabhart and provides guidance on the nature of duty, righteousness, and devotion.</p>
